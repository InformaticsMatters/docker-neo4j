# The InformaticsMatters neo4j container image
A specialised build of neo4j used by a number of InformaticsMatters projects.

>   **WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH**
 
>   Our implementation is sensitive to the underlying neo4j image. Development
    therefore takes place on branches aligned with the corresponding neo4j
    version number. At the time of writing active branches are `3.5.25` and
    `4.2.1`.
