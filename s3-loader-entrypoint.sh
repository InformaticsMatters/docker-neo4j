#       AWS_BUCKET              is set ('im-fragnet')
#       AWS_BUCKET_PATH         is a path to RAW vendor files
#                               (like 'raw/vendor/molport/2021-02')

# We need some key environment variables
# before we do anything sensible...
#
# AWS_*         Are AWS credentials for accessing the S3 bucket
# CYPHER_ROOT   The path to the cypher script directory (typically /data)
# GRAPH_WIPE    If 'yes' then all data is erased, forcing
#               a resync with S3 and a reload of the Graph data
# POST_SLEEP_S  A value (seconds) to sleep at the end of the script.
#               this allows the user to inspect the environment prior
#               to the execution moving to the graph container.
# SYNC_PATH     Is the directory to synchronise S3 content with
#               Typically the data-loader directory
#
# After downloading the source files the loader expects:
#
# - A 'load-neo4j.sh' script in /data/${SYNC_PATH}
# - The loader script must refer to at least one file
# - All files referred to must exist
#
# If these conditions aren't met the loader halts (does not exit).
